# Types-of-Functions---ETH-AVAX
In this project, I write a smart contract to create my ERC20 token and deploy it using Remix. And the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.


## Description
The following Solidity code will model a contract named Nana whose core function is enforcing an ERC20 token named Nana possessing the symbol TKN. It starts with 400 tokens handed to the deployer. It also allows circulating new tokens, wrecking them, and transferring them to other addresses. Furthermore, the contract includes all the required statements to ensure valid operations.

## Usage/Features
1. Transfer the tokens to several other addresses.
2.  Initialization with the 400 first tokens to the deployer of the contract's wallet.
3. Other minted tokens are sent to the assigned new addresses.
4.  Tokens burn out of the sender's amount.
5. Shift of tokens to other addresses.
6. Strong input validation to check on the correctness of operations.


### Executing program

* Use any Solidity compiler. (I used Remix IDE)
* search for the solidity compiler and create a file.
* Once done coding, compile it with the compiler in the same version of pragma solidity.
* Deploy & execute transactions window and click deploy.
* On the deployed contracts panel, check for the mint, burn, and transfer, which allows you to put the address and the token.
* Once done minting, burning, and transferring, you can also check the balance of the address you input.

You can also set the address and token to explore them!

### NOTE

* Search for the green check in every transaction you make, if you see it then it means that the transaction is successful.
